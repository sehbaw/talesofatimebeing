i have this running document inside my obsidian (notion we question you) because the thoughts are never ending and have to be somewhere
my journal cannot compass this many thoughts not with all the drawing I do.

- I judge people based on the way they talk about public transportation
- how has social media made the concepts of "coming of age" and "rite of passage" even more unbearable? 
	- actually I keep seeing people feeling lost bc the romanticization thing only works for so long - ignorance is bliss thooo
	- sick of seeing these movies, vlogs, tv shows making me think I need more when I am fine
		- can we showcase gratitude rather than greed!!!! isn't gonna hurt anybody!!!
- why do people think companies, organizations, institutions are the reason they thrive? THESE INSTITUTIONS NEED YOU MORE THAN YOU NEED THEM>>>!>!>!>>>@
	- understanding the meaning of a "career" 
	- specialization is stupid and it just another reinforcement of uneducation...fill your capacity with one thing as a way to not think critically or learn about anything else 
		- PhD student that doesnt know how to use a dishwasher but creates new knowledge can we be serious!!! what is the world we are living in 
- why I don't want to move on (to another city or place)
	- thnking about how we constantly make jokes that if you havent left your hometown or you come back that you somewhat of a loser. thinking about shaymar higgs and how he grew up to now work so hard to make it better. what is wrong with not leaving? especially when we you are from. sure it is important to see the world but also it is not the end of the world if you dont?? i feel conflicted saying this because I know firsthand that leaving is important in a sense of understanding culture and phenomenon. you can't read and watch your way through experiences and people. look at austin. how much I heard about texas concerned about how things would go but it turned out to be such a game changer BUT I can also accredit most of that to the fellowship 
- we need to get rid of monopolies, like A DECADE AGO 
	- sick of amazon and google, all these organizations r killing us 
- "I don't work in a political domain" ok and?
	- thinking about how people are so unempowered to speak up in the domains they work in...goes back to my understanding that true passion is caring about something as a whole good and bad ---the entire picture 
	- i guess this is why I work on things that arent exploratory because yeah the only way you get to do that is that if you have the ability to do so...like you got into college bc you had someone or something supporting you maybe a 
- is everything reused? aka proprietary software is ridiculous
	- thinking about that tiktok video I saw from the 1000th tech person I follow on that stupid app, talking about how as a designer they dont design anything, resulting in a lot of "pixel-pushing" which makes me think about how I keep getting recommended videos on youtube about 
	- in the context of academia even though u are creating new knowledge, the way it consumes u is just IWRGOUERNGEOURNG
- let's talk about decentralization
	- I kind of just want to talk about why web 2.0 exists in the first place because not only is it a result of capitalism, priortizing profit but specialization and uneducatioN!!!!!!!!! idk I need to read more because NFTs and blockchain r not going anywhere sick to my stomach
- good art takes a while
	- thinking about how people work on films for years and years. alice wu (THE QUEER ICON) but I wonder why that is? because art is vulnerable and art is to be made rather than perfected but when it comes to entertainment it feels like there are other things on the line. reputation at most, because films aren't just something you can make so easily...\
	- iteration
- what if the reason seattle is a tech hub is because it so gloomy? same thing with sf as it is known to be gloomy. i mean why else would someone want to be there...if the weather was good then it would be depressing for them to be inside all day staring at a screen vs being outside!!!!!! gloomy weather is an excuse to be stuck inside all day 
- tech moguls arent interesting and need to stop writing memoirs
	- everytime a tech bro recommends a book I shiver like wtf r u talking about 
	- steve jobs idgaf about you in fact I lowkey hate you because of you we have apple trying to take over the world
		- did you ever mean for it to be that way? when does the mission began to stray?
- tariffed of wasted potential
	- I wanna be an engineer, I want to write, I want to build data visualizations, I want to work in infosec, the list goes on and on
		- the world is my oyster I can do all these things wth 
- why the fuck are placing hierarchy on learning? bitch everything matters
- be kind to thy own brother 
- will reading fiction books about life make it more sense? 
	- one of the reasons I guess I am not interested in fiction books is because the void is gone and stays gone pretty much most of the sense. 
- maybe I should stop watching TV
	- it is just for comfort like it seriously does not add anything to my life 
		- but it does doesnt it?
- it is so strange how ivy leaues or top institutions go hand and hand with big tech
	- i mean not really but still confusing and concerning
- entertainment is so beautiful yet so scaryy
-
